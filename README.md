# Unit Converter
Unit converter web page. Webpage that converts values from certain units of measurement to anothers. It uses the PHP built-in web server, and it manages requests and routing manually through PHP predefined variables ($_GET, $_POST, $_SERVER). It has two main pages, one to submit the data and the other to output the result. Before providing the html document, it performs some templating to fill selects with only certain kinds of units of measurement (Length, Weight and Temperature) to avoid the need of multiple very similar HTML source files. For some basic styling it uses Bootstrap.
